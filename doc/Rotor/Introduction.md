# Rotor 
Simple device driven by arduino board, enables ether transmitter or receiver to be rotated around it's center of rotation. The goal of rotor is to rotate antenna with great precision, and repeatability. The speed of rotation does not matter, neither does time to response, error tolerance is around 1Â°.

Biggest obstacles when designing the rotor shaft are:
- concentric cable to witch antenna is connected, this cable is not flexible thus presents big resistance when antena is turned against it. This resistance is multiplied by height of rotor shaft.
- slack between parts
